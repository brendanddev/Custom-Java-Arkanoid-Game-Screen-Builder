# Java-Assignment-1
This Assignment was made for the Programming in Java course at Mohawk College in the 2023/2024 Winter Semester. It focused on placing drawings on a canvas, and getting comfortable with Graphics Contexts. I tried to go above and beyond by adding my own images, and generating random colors for each brick.
